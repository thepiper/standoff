Hello World
January, 19th, 2016
There was once when I said, 'Oh, yeah, I'll just get my website set up this weekend. No problem, it'll be easy'. Actually there was a lot of times that I said something along those lines, to myself, or someone else.
Funny thing is those words usually mean that it took a month or so of grinding against one problem after another. 
And in that spirit, I present my personal website: Time to Completion: probably never.
